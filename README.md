# CSS Pricing Table - Proposal, Wedding, Honeymoon

This is a pricing table project that I created as part of my learning journey while taking a Basic CSS Course. The project features a creative pricing table designed to represent three stages of a relationship: Proposal, Wedding, and Honeymoon. Each plan is uniquely styled and designed to provide a clean, engaging, and responsive experience for users.

## Features

- **Custom Icons**: Each plan is paired with a relevant icon representing the stages of a relationship: Proposal, Wedding, and Honeymoon. These icons add a unique visual element to the table.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the table looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each plan includes a playful action button (e.g., "Say Yes!", "Make It Official", and "Embark on Adventure") that adds interactivity and enhances user engagement.
- **Clean, Modern Design**: The table is designed with simplicity and elegance in mind, using minimalistic styles and smooth animations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the pricing table.
- **CSS**: Key styling techniques like Flexbox, margin/padding, and font styling were used to create a clean, responsive design.
- **Icons**: Custom icons that represent each stage of the relationship journey were integrated into the design to make it visually appealing.

## Structure

The project consists of three main pricing plans:

- **Proposal Plan**: The entry-level option for starting the journey, symbolizing the beginning of a relationship.
- **Wedding Plan**: The middle-tier plan symbolizing a long-lasting commitment, offering 24/7 support and additional features.
- **Honeymoon Plan**: The premium plan, designed for maximizing the potential of the relationship, offering the best features and benefits.
